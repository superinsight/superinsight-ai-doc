## Build a Report

Besides real-time file analysis, Superinsight allows you to select multiple files and generate a complex report that helps you significantly reduce time you spend on reading tons of paper and get your claim way more efficiently.

Simply click on the "Build Report" button on the left, choose the way you want to build, and select all the files you want to be included in reports that Superinsight supports. Before you submit to generate, make sure your file list is correct!

Before you build the report, you can either choose the build-in options that Superinsight made for you or use your own prompts to generate the specific reports.

Now we offer 4 types of report, including:

* Personal Injury
* Social Security Disability
* Veteran Disability
* Mass Tort (Build-in only)

!!! TIP

After files are submitted, you will see the unclickable report in the "Reports" tab building behind the scenes. Once it is complete, it will turn black with the download icon, then you can download and check your reports anytime you want.

## Download Reports

You can download your report in **PDF**, **DOCX**, or **CSV** format depending on the type of report you built.

In PDF format, Superinsight will combine the report and the original files so that you can easily find the critical evidence after you click on the table of contents we provided, and we will add the bookmarks for you as well.

In CSV format, Superinsight lists all the impairment issues row by row so you can easily find them and link with the source documents.
