# Manage Report

## 1. Build a Report

Besides real-time file analysis, Superinsight allows you to select multiple files and generate a complex report that helps you significantly reduce time you spend on reading tons of paper and get your claim way more efficiently.

Simply click on the "Build Report" button on the left and select all the files you want to be included in reports Superinsight supported. Before you submit to generate, make sure your file list is correct!

* Veteran Disability
* Social Security Disability
* Mass Tort
* Personal Injury

!!! TIP
    Feel free to [contact us](mailto:help@superinsight.ai) if you need any other reports we're not supporting yet. We'd love to discuss that!
