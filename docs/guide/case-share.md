# Share Case


Sometimes, you might need to share information about the case with your stakeholders. For example, you might share medical chronology reports with a physician to check or STR files with your claimant if you're practicing VA.

Now you can share your cases with every stakeholder who needs to read files and reports. Of course, you can share cases with your co-workers and let them build reports for the cases.

## 1. Share Your Cases

To share your cases, click on the "**Share**" button in the navigator on left or click the 3 dots "Action" button beside your cases' name.

You can share your cases with a single user via Email invitation or you can share with user groups you own or belong to.

After you share a case, you can see a shared list below and find out who this case is shared with.

=== "Share List"

In the sharing list, you can find a gear icon and a delete icon next to each sharing recipient. You can use these to remove the share or adjust the recipient's access permissions for this case.

You can set access permissions for the Documents, Reports, and Contact sections of this case. Each section can be configured with one of three permissions: **Write**, **Read**, or **None**.

## 2. Accept the Sharing

When someone shares cases with you via Email, you should receive an Email Invitation. In the meantime, your app notification will receive the invite as well.
